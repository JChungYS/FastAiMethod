"# FastAiMethod" 

Ai/Robot was kind of dream when I was a child. I eventually came across Fast.AI and AI became so close to me.
I have taken portion or the whole online courses(mostly audit) diffent NLP online courses, Andrew Ng ML learning.
Fast.AI really help me to take off. Jeremy Howards and Rachel Thomsaid that methodology of Fast.ai is from top-down. I think they started with top-down. Considering Fast.AI is a model of learning AI, how can we improve this model and make it more effective. Thank you for Rachel's inspiration of the importance of blog writing. Thus, here I start.

Imagine FastAI and AI community is a neural network, and every one of us is a super-power neuron. How can we organize ourselves to a super neural network.

Questions to start with the analogy of neural network:

#What dataset are we going to manage? What do we need to know about it?


#What is the outcome that I or we want to see?


#If AI and Machine Learning geeting a lot of resources for the development, comparing with other discipline, what would be the outcome our society for short term and long term? 

#We are fasting to to achieve something .... but what? Faster the Better?

#Top down or Bottom up? How top is the methodology, how bottom is the methodology? How does this change over time and depends on the subject matters?

#What would be the best outcome with highest rate of accuracy?

#How do we apply the universal approximation theorem and regression in our AI teaching/learning method?

#How are the personal profiles of the learner depends on the learner, depends on the instructor?

#Regression rather than the top down.

#If all fast.ai community is a model, what do we want to achieve, if the model
is an archetecture, what we are going to achieve?

#How free are we to choose the the parameters in and parameter out(choose to write a blog, publish or share with social media)? 

#Are we randomly generated as random.seed(x). 

#How would you prioritized the above questions? How are the related with other in what structures? These questions have started training our neurons? Let's think together, learn together and solve our common problems.
