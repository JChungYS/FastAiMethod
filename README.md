"# FastAiMethod" 

Ai/Robot was kind of dream when I was a child. I eventually came across Fast.AI and AI became so close to me.
I have taken portion or the whole online courses(mostly audit) diffent NLP online courses, Andrew Ng ML learning.
Fast.AI really help me to take off. Jeremy Howards and Rachel Thomsaid that methodology of Fast.ai is from top-down. I think they started with top-down. Considering Fast.AI is a model of learning AI, how can we improve this model and make it more effective. Thank you for Rachel's inspiration of the importance of blog writing. Thus, here I start.
